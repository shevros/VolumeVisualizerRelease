Current development TODOs:

 - XYZ Gizmo for navigating around scene
 - Scale, rotate, snap gizmo for manipulating data
 - Add data slicing back in, with corresponding UI control



Known bugs:

 - When loading a volume, the painter wants to paint regardless of mouse position. This goes away once the mouse has moved over the paint bar
 - When clicking the "top" of the paint bar, color is painted, but only partially. This behaviour doesn't occur when painting the "bottom" of the bar
 - When working with a very large volume, and scaling it high, the scroll wheel doesn't work because the pointer raycast is beginning inside the volume's surface
